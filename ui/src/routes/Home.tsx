      <h1>Cycling community and competitions in Montenegro</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Cycling MNE, a community-driven platform dedicated to organizing
        and promoting amateur cycling competitions across Montenegro. Our goal is to
        connect riders, clubs, and volunteers to make it easy to discover events,
        register to race, and share routes and results.
      </p>
      <p>
        From coastal rides along the Adriatic to challenging climbs in the mountains,
        Montenegro offers a diverse landscape for cyclists of all levels. We aim to
        showcase these routes, provide clear event information, and keep logistics
        simple for organizers and participants alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this platform, you can browse upcoming events, register quickly, and
        stay informed about schedules and updates. Organizers can create events in
        minutes and manage registrations without hassle.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an MVP, we focus on the essentials: creating events, registering riders,
        and listing participants. We welcome feedback from the community to help us
        improve and grow responsibly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you ride for fitness, adventure, or competition, Cycling MNE is here
        to support your next ride in Montenegro.
